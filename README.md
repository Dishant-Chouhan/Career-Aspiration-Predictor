# Career Aspiration Predictor

## Overview
The **Career Aspiration Predictor** is a machine learning model designed to assist students, educators, and career counselors in identifying potential career paths based on academic performance, extracurricular activities, and other relevant factors. By leveraging a Random Forest Classifier, this model provides predictions for a student's likely career aspirations, helping them make informed decisions about their future.

## Features
The model considers the following input features to make predictions:

- **Part-time Job Status**: Whether the student is engaged in a part-time job.
- **Absence Days**: The number of days the student has been absent from school.
- **Extracurricular Activities**: Participation in activities beyond academics, such as sports or clubs.
- **Weekly Self-Study Hours**: Hours spent on self-directed study each week.
- **Subject Scores**: Academic scores in the following subjects:
  - Math
  - History
  - Physics
  - Chemistry
  - Biology
  - English
  - Geography

These features provide a holistic view of a student's performance, habits, and interests, enabling accurate predictions of their career aspirations.

## Model Training
- **Algorithm**: The model is built using the **Random Forest Classifier**, an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **Dataset**: The training dataset includes labeled examples, where each student's attributes are paired with their career aspiration labels. This allows the model to learn patterns and relationships between the features and aspirations.
- **Process**: 
  - Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
  - Feature Engineering: Selecting and encoding relevant features for input into the model.
  - Model Training: Using the Random Forest algorithm to learn from the training data.
  - Evaluation: Testing the model on unseen data to validate its accuracy and performance.

## Predictions
The model predicts a student's **career aspiration** based on the input features. For example:
- A student with high math scores, consistent self-study, and no extracurricular involvement might be predicted as aspiring to become a **scientist**.
- A student with strong communication skills and active participation in extracurricular activities may be predicted to aspire to a **managerial role**.

These predictions are generated by analyzing patterns in the training data and applying them to new inputs.
