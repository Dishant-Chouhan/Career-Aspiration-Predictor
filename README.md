# Career-Aspiration-Predictor
This is a machine learning model built to predict the career aspirations of students based on various factors such as their academic performance, extracurricular activities, and part-time job status. The model utilizes a random forest classifier trained on a dataset containing information about students' attributes and their corresponding career aspirations.

Features:
Part-time Job Status: Whether the student has a part-time job or not.
Absence Days: The number of days the student was absent.
Extracurricular Activities: Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities.
Weekly Self-Study Hours: The number of hours the student spends on self-study per week.
Subject Scores: Scores in various subjects including math, history, physics, chemistry, biology, English, and geography.
Model Training:
The model was trained using the random forest algorithm, a popular ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy. The training dataset consisted of labeled examples where each student's attributes were associated with their career aspirations.

Predictions:
Given a set of input features provided by the user, the model predicts the most likely career aspiration of the student. The predictions are based on the patterns learned from the training data, allowing the model to generalize and make accurate predictions for new instances.

Usage:
This model can be used by students, educators, and career counselors to gain insights into potential career paths based on academic performance and other relevant factors. By providing input values for the features, users can obtain predictions for their career aspirations, helping them make informed decisions about their future endeavors.
